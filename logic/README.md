# AstroTradeRB – Core Logic

This folder defines the brain of the AstroTradeRB system.

## What lives here
- GAP logic (gap up / gap down decision)
- OTM option selection rules
- Time + astro alignment logic
- Entry, hold, exit & risk rules
- Reasoning (WHY trade exists)

## Important
- No signals are random
- Every trade must have a reason
- Risk is defined before reward
